      <h2>Functional Programming</h2>
      <p>
        For my first post I want to start a collection of resources I have come across that
        help to describe and explain functional programming. Last summer I accepted an internship
        position at Mentor Graphics, and my team lead, <a href="http://www.joescii.com">Joe Barnes</a>,
        suggested a MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) to help prepare me and get my feet wet with
        Scala and the functional programming paradigm in general. He recommended I start with
        <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/progfun">Functional Programming Principles in Scala</a>,
        a course instructed by Martin Odersky, designer of the Scala language, on Coursera. This course
        was my first exposure to functional programming in any way.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the last nine or so months, I feel like I have been exposed to and experienced "a whole new
        world." I have fallen in love with FP (functional programming). But along the way I've really
        had to learn what exactly is functional programming. Not only for my own understanding,
        but I've had conversations with my classmates, with typically the same experience as
        I had before, and needed to be able to properly explain my new found discovery of
        awesomeness. Discussion also began in the monthly functional meet-up group,
        <a href="http://huntfunc.github.io">HuntFunc</a>, on how to have meaningful conversations
        with others new to the functional programming paradigm.
      </p>
      <p>
        I will come back to more language specific resources in a moment. Each language has its
        pros and cons, but we need to understand the defining characteristics of this usually
        unfamiliar paradigm before we try to compare the various tools that try to execute it.
        Kris Jenkins wrote two great posts in December on the topic. Part 1: 
        <a href="http://blog.jenkster.com/2015/12/what-is-functional-programming.html">What is Functional Programming?</a>
        and Part 2: <a href="http://blog.jenkster.com/2015/12/which-programming-languages-are-functional.html">
        Which Programming Languages are Functional?</a>. These two are my new favorite posts
        and emphasise how in the FP world complexity and side-effects are evil and the importance
        of avoiding them and striving for more pure functions.

        Programming languages can be typically viewed on a scale of how functional it is. Scala
        is considered a hybrid language, that allows for object-oriented and functional paradigms,
        and is often looked at as a bridge from OO (Java, in particular) to FP. From the Scala world,
        the courses that I mentioned earlier (and a few more) are being transitioned to the new
        <a href="https://scala.epfl.ch">ScalaCenter</a>, which will soon offer a Scala mini-degree
        offered on Coursera. On the paradigm scale, Haskell is located closer to the functional
        side. Although I have yet to finish this ebook, Christopher Allen and Julie Moronuki have
        introduced <a href="http://haskellbook.com">Haskell Programming from First Principles</a>,
        and it is looking very promising so far.

        I think this will be enough of my rambling for my first blog post. I think I may delve further
        into the various programming languages that are closer to the functional programming side of
        the paradigm scale next time and discuss various differences they have, such as static or
        dynamic typing. Thanks for reading!
