      <h1>About Britany:</h1>
      <img id="profile-pic" src="images/britany.jpg" alt="Britany">
      <p>Britany is a Senior Computer Science major at University of Alabama in Huntsville
        graduating in December, 2016. (Yay!) She started working in an alternating semester internship/co-op
        August, 2015 as a Software Engineer Intern at Mentor Graphics. At Mentor Graphics, Britany has gained
        experience in web development, fallen in love with functional programming, and grown a hunger to be
        involved in the local tech community. Her long-term career goal is to become a full-stack developer. She
        loves to learn and takes advantage of all the many resources available now, such as Pluralsight, Team
        TreeHouse, Coursera, and conferences, like our very own DevSpace. She is also one of the moderators
        of the local area tech Slack group: <a href="https://tech256.com">tech256</a>.
